## Regional Socio-economic and Environmental Factors Influencing Child Obesity Prevalence in London

### Intro: 
The project used a multiple regression model to evaluate how the Socio-economic Status factor, the Social Environment factor and the Urban Environment factor affected the child obesity prevalence in a ward in London.

### Data:
Dependent variable - Child Obesity Prevalence: [2010/11-2012/13 Year 6 Child Obesity Prevalence Data at Ward Level](https://data.london.gov.uk/download/prevalence-childhood-obesity-borough/0c81f268-499c-4f53-a23d-99f948fc7c4a/MSOA_Ward_LA_Obesity.xlsx)

**Other sources:**
The independent variables that are selected are from different official sources: Census 2011; GLA Population Projection data, and Midyear estimates from Greater London Authority; HM Revenue and Customs; Department for Education; Metropolitan Police Service; Transport for London; Greenspace Information for Greater London.

### Methods:
Descriptive Analysis, OLS Regression Model, VIF, Residual Analysis

### Results of Analysis: 
The results showed the ratio of children in poverty, the ratio of *level 4 and above qualifications*, the ratio of *unauthorised absence in all schools*, crime rate, population density, and the ratio of *households with access to open space* are the factors that influenced the prevalence of child obesity, and the findings align with broader evidence that socio-economic disadvantage, limited educational attainment, and high residential density ‚Äî factors often tied to weaker health awareness; and lower access to resources ‚Äî contribute to higher obesity prevalence, whereas improved educational conditions and more accessible open spaces help mitigate it. We can conclude that the ward with fewer children from poor families, the better educated their parents, safer community environment, lower dropout rate, the greater accessibility to open space, and lower residential density, will have a lower prevalence of obesity among children.

### Discussions: 
To solve the problems about child obesity, in the future, the whole society needs to make efforts to reduce child obesity prevalences, government departments can provide moderate subsidies for children from poor families, urban planning can consider more spaces for children‚Äôs activities in areas with higher population density, and management needs to improve the security control of the community to guarantee a secure social environment for children‚Äôs activities.

### Limitations: 
Firstly, for the selection of the independent variable, as this study is at ward level, and available data sources are limited, so we can find more representative and targeted ward level data related to SES, society, environment in the future to adjust the model. 

Secondly, this study is based on prevalence data in 2010-2012, so the result may not be similar to more recent situations, and subsequent studies can use the data of more recent periods to simulate and adjust this model. 

Finally, the study only investigates the factors influencing the obesity prevalence of the year 6 children and lacks the discussion of the obesity prevalence changing over time, and subsequent studies can have a focused tracking on the weight changes of a group of children from reception to year 6 to analyse the specific factors that affect the obesity prevalence among children.
